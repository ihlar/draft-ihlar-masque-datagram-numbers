--- abstract

This document defines a sequence number extension to HTTP datagrams used to carry proxied UDP payload or IP datagrams. This extension is useful when HTTP datagrams are transported on top of a multipath protocol that does not ensure in-order delivery as it allows a masque endpoint to implement reordering logic specific to its needs.
